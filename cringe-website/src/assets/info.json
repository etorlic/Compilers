With cringy features such as using \"==\" for assignments and \"=\" for comparisons, a programmer will cringe at the first touch of this cutting edge language."

      "We thought we would make an imprint on the programming community by making a cringy language. Everyone disses on the top languages for reasons the developers didn't even consider. So we thought we would make a language that is designed to be cringy. The programmer should feel second-hand embarrassment while reading and writing in Cringe--."

      "This language is designed for the experienced and pretentious programmers who think they've gotten too skilled at programming. Our divergence from traditional programming conventions will throw them into a loop for sure. This language is designed for the general programming hobbyist who is looking for a good laugh, while at the same time being proud and mortified at the same time at the abomination of code they have written. In short, this is a language made for anyone and everyone who is looking to have a cringy time."
